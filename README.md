🚫 Stay Productive - Website Blocker Chrome Extension
A lightweight Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by blocking distracting websites for a user-defined number of hours. When you attempt to revisit the blocked site, the extension shows a countdown and notifies you of the remaining block duration before automatically closing the tab.

🧠 Features
⏳ Block websites for custom number of hours (1–24)
⛔ Instant blocking with a 5-second countdown
🔁 Shows remaining time if you revisit a blocked website
📦 Uses Chrome local storage for persistence
🧼 Clean and minimal popup UI

🛠️ How It Works
When you open the popup, it displays the current website.
You enter the number of hours you'd like to block the site for (1–24).
The site gets added to a block list with an expiration timestamp.

-> When you revisit a blocked site:
An alert shows the remaining block time
The tab is automatically closed after alert confirmation.
